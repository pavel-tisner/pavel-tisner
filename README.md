## 👋 Hi, I'm Pavel

I'm a career-switching developer based in the Netherlands, currently focused on **JavaScript** and core web development.

Before moving into tech, I worked for several years in **real estate**, gaining experience in project-based work, client relations, and structured decision-making.

- JavaScript (ES6+), DOM, basics of frontend development  
- Git, GitHub, CLI, collaborative workflows  
- Interest in **global history**
- Learning in public and open to collaboration

I plan to learn SQL and Python as core tools for data and product analytics.
Next, I want to build skills in product metrics, A/B testing, and analytics tools to support product decisions.
