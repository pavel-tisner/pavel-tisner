## 👋 Hi, I'm Pavel

I'm a career-switching developer based in the Netherlands, currently focused on **JavaScript** and core web development.

Before moving into tech, I worked for several years in **real estate**, gaining experience in project-based work, client relations, and structured decision-making.

I bring a problem-solving mindset, prefer learning fundamentals, writing clear code, and building things step by step.

- JavaScript (ES6+), DOM, basics of frontend development  
- Git, GitHub, CLI, collaborative workflows  
- Interest in **global history**, long-term processes, and complex systems  
- Learning in public and open to collaboration
