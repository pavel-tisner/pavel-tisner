## 👋 Hi, I'm Pavel

I'm a career-switching developer based in the Netherlands, currently focused on **JavaScript** and core web development.

I bring a structured, problem-solving mindset from a project-driven background and prefer learning fundamentals, writing clear code, and building things step by step.

- JavaScript (ES6+), DOM, basics of frontend development  
- Git, GitHub, CLI, collaborative workflows  
- Learning in public and open to collaboration
